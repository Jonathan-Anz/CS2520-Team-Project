# CS2520-Team-Project
Performance evaluation of pi computations

How to run:
- Run the driver class script

TODO:
- Implement the Leibniz method
- Implement the Monte Carlo method
- Add more methods?
- Use the time module to get the execution time of each method
- Compare how many iterations each method takes to get to an accurate value
- Get test runs
- Graph the data for visual display of accuracy and time?
